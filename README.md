# How to Run
Run the rlbot.py file with an argument specifying either "training" or "predicting".
```{bash}
python rlbot.py training
```
Before running update the filepath variable above the main loop (found at bottom of the file) to change where the model is saved to. This path is also where the prediction loop will find the model you wish to use.
